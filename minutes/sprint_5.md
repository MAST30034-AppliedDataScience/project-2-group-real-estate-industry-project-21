**Group Members:** Anshan, Jenny, Vivian, Zirui (Eddie)

**Agenda**
- Catch up to sprint schedule
- OpenRouteService has a request limit per account
    - Other group members can also make accounts and help
- Problem with combining datasets: SA2s and suburb borders don't line up, some SA2s are 1.5 of a suburb, not sure how combine areas
- Remember the 3 big questions
    1. What are the most important internal and external features in predicting rental prices? (This
can be at the granularity of the groupsâ€™ choosing)
    2. What are the top 10 suburbs with the highest predicted growth rate?
    3. What are the most liveable and affordable suburbs according to your chosen metrics?
